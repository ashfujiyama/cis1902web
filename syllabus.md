## Course Components

### Lecture
Lecture slides, recordings, and assignments will be linked on the [schedule page](#schedule].

### Assignments
Exact due dates for assignments will be shown in Gradescope, but in general:

- Assignments will be released after lecture on Thursdays
- Homeworks (HW) will be due the following Friday at 11:59pm ET
- Worksheets (WS) will be due the following Wednesday at 11:59pm ET

### Ed Discussion
We will primarily use Ed for discussion outside of lecture and office hours. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and the teaching staff. Rather than emailing, we encourage you to post your questions on Ed. If it is something serious or you are having difficulty with the course, then please reach out directly.

### Grading

The grading breakdown is as follows:

- Six homeworks (60%)
- Final project (25%)
- Completion-graded worksheets (10%)
- Participation (5%)

### Late Assignments
Everybody gets five late days for homeworks, and up to two can be used for a single assignment. We'll track late submissions via Gradescope and will record your late day usage automatically, though definitely feel free to ask us at any point in the semester how many late days you have remaining. Beyond these, any late day will incur a penalty of 20% as of the change of date.

Late days only apply to homeworks, so they may not be used for worksheets or the final project. 

### Collaboration
You are permitted (and encouraged) to discuss the homework problems with other class members, but these discussions are to be limited to high-level concepts. In particular, you are absolutely not permitted to copy/share code or implementation details. Similarly, you are not permitted to use or consult code found on the internet for any of your assignments. The only context where it is permitted to share code is during the final project, during which you are allowed to collaborate with your team members.

Similarly, you are not allowed to upload your code to publicly accessible places (like public GitHub repositories), and you are not allowed to access anyone else’s code (or another team's code during the final project). If you discover someone else’s code online, please report it to the course staff via a private note on Ed.

### Generative AI

We recognize the increasing prevalence of generative AI tools in a variety of applications. We acknowledge that AI can be a useful learning tool. It can help clarify ideas or help you explore related concepts. However, it can also [generate plenty of authoritative-sounding nonsense information](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/chatgpt-is-a-bullshit-generator-but). Without some understanding of fundamental concepts and knowing how to cross-reference model output against an external non-generative-model source of information, it can be hard to tell the difference. Our goal is to help you develop a strong understanding of fundamental concepts and processes without relying on generative AI.

To this end:
- Avoid using AI to generate code or text for homework assignments, peer reviews, or content summaries.
- Do not present AI-generated content as your own work or without citation.
- We recognize that generative AI tools may be built-in to your working environment. If you do end up using generative AI for your work (homework, projects, or other graded materials), we require that you explicitly document how, where, and why it was used, and reflect briefly on how it affected your work and learning.

If you have questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.
