Final Project
=============================================================
## Key Dates

- Milestone 1: **due TBD**
- Milestone 2: **due TBD**

## Description

For the course's final project, create whatever you want to build -- we hope the material we have covered in the course has shown how flexible Python really is! **You can work alone or with a partner,** although partner projects will be expected to be more elaborate. We expect that the project will roughly be on the scale of one homework assignment, so use that as a guideline of scoping out your project idea. We encourage you to build something you can show off on your resume or Github profile!

## Project ideas

Below are some *suggestions* for project ideas:

- Build a command-line utility to manipulate files or play a game in the terminal (such as through the [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) module).

- Scrape and process data (using requests + [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)) from the web and develop a interactive visualization (using ipywidgets or [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)) of that data.

- Train and compare machine learning models and/or perform EDA on an existing dataset (such as data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)).

- Create a web app, such as a Twitter clone, email client, or messaging app. Be sure to keep things simple if you go down this line as it may become overwhelming fairly quickly.

Of course, you are not limited to these suggestions, and feel free to use other libraries outside of the ones we have covered in class! You are also encouraged to come to office hours to discuss your project ideas and get feedback from the teaching staff.

## Implementation Requirements [14 pts]

- One class definition **[2 pts]**
    - with at least two dunder methods **[2 pts]**
- One non-trivial first-party module (modules that come built-in with python) **[2 pts]**
    - examples of what we have used: argparse, json, unittest
- Two non-trivial third-party modules (modules that need to be installed) **[4 pts]**
    - examples of what we have used: requests, pandas, numpy, pytorch
- In-line documentation and code style: each function should have proper documentation (similar to the docstrings we have provided in each assignment) **[4 pts]**

## Other Deliverables [5 pts]

- A file named README.md giving a project description, installation/running instructions (if applicable), and description of code structure **[2 pts]**
- A .mp4 demo video walking through the running final project (~2-5 minutes) **[3 pts]**
    - The video does *not* have to be highly polished -- a screen recording walking through and describing the functionality of your project you want to showcase is sufficient.
    - If you have issues submitting a .mp4 to Gradescope, you can provide a Youtube or Google Drive link to your video.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Proposal [2 pts]

#### **Project Description**

Write a 1-2 paragraph description of your project as a **README.md** file. Include any packages you think you might use, and how you will use them. Feel free to treat this as an early-stage version of the final README you will submit, but that is not required.

#### **Code Stubs**

In addition to your description, create any **.py** files that you may need for your project, with code stubs for the classes and functions you plan on implementing. This should look a lot like the starter files for the homework assignments, with docstrings describing the functionality of classes and functions. If you have already begun implementing your project, you can submit your in-progress code as well -- no need to generate a separate file with only code stubs.

{: .note}
The code stubs do **not** have to be complete for Milestone 1; this is just to make sure you're thinking about the implementation design of your project ahead of time.

### Milestone 2: Full Project Submission [23 pts]

This milestone will be the complete implementation of your project. Any changes from your proposal are completely fine -- even if you switch gears and your final product is different from your Milestone 1 proposal. Milestone 2 will be graded with regards to the implementation requirements and deliverables given above, so as long as you follow those guidelines your submission will be accepted.

## Rubric

| Section | Points |
|---------|--------|
| Milestone 1 (completion graded) | 2 |
| Implementation requirements | 14 |
| README.md documentation | 2 |
| Project demo video | 3 |
| Code style and efficiency | 4 |
| **Total** | 25

## Submission

### Milestone 1

You will upload to Gradescope a **.zip** file containing:
    - a README.md description file
    - your project code stubs (any .py and/or .ipynb files)

**Milestone 1 is due TBD.** It will be graded for completion, not for correctness/style -- we just want you to start thinking about your final project earlier and to get some feedback from the teaching staff.

### Milestone 2

You will upload to Gradescope a **.zip** file containing:
    - a README.md description file
    - your project code (any .py and/or .ipynb files)
    - a .mp4 demo video or link to Youtube/Google Drive

**Milestone 2 is due TBD.**

### Group Submissions

If you are working with another classmate, you should use the "Group Submission" option on Gradescope so that we only have a single submission to view and grade for your team.
